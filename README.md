# What a Vue

Small personal app where I explore Vue JS approach on:

- Components
- Events
- Data binding
- Model management
- Filters
- Mixins
- Best practices
- etc.

## Running the app

- Install gulp
- Check out repository, then `cd <repo-name>`
- `npm install`
- `gulp` (will bundle and watch, as well as run a server with live reload)
- Go to localhost:8080
